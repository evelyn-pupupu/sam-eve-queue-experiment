Logic of the Codebase

1. .php files contain all executable logic for the experiment (arrival, service, queueing, UI rendering, etc.).
2. .json files only store pre-generated data (arrival time list, service time list, price list, customer items).
3. Whole structure: "generate_sequences.php" produces the arrival-time list and service-time list --> writes them into JSON files --> these JSONs are loaded by the experiment PHP pages.

How to Modify the Code

1. Modify directly in GitHub.
2. download the code, edit locally in any text editor (Notepad, VS Code, etc.).
3. The speed-up logic (arrival-time and service-time generation) is located in
src/generate_sequences.php.
4. The final experiment versions are:
        "parallelQueue_formal_speed_up.php"
        "pooledQueue_formal_speed_up.php"
These two experiment files load the sped-up JSON files:
         "config/arrival_times_speed_up.json"
         "config/service_times_speed_up.json"

How to Test Locally (without the server)
1. Download this GitHub repository
Click “Code → Download ZIP”. Unzip to any folder.
2. Install PHP
Download from:
https://windows.php.net/download/
(Choose the latest Thread Safe x64 ZIP → extract it.)

3. Start a local PHP server
Open Command Prompt, then run:
cd C:\Users\z5282586\Downloads\bizLab_sam_project-main
(Change this path to your extracted code folder.)

Then start PHP:

C:\Users\z5282586\Downloads\php-8.4.x-Win32-vs17-x64\php.exe -S localhost:8000 -t C:\Users\z5282586\Downloads\bizLab_sam_project-main
(Change paths to your PHP folder and your project folder.)

If successful, Command Prompt will show:
Development Server (http://localhost:8000) started

4. Run sequence generation
Open a browser and go to:
http://localhost:8000/src/generate_sequences.php

If it prints:
“Random sequences have been generated and saved to the config directory.”
then the .json files have been updated successfully.

5. Test the experiment
Now open:
http://localhost:8000/src/pooledQueue_formal_speed_up.php
or
http://localhost:8000/src/parallelQueue_formal_speed_up.php

Both pages will load using the newly generated arrival/service time lists.
